# Webpack Starter Kit

A basic webpack starter kit that compiles your JavaScript and LESS (you can change to SCSS) into separate bundles.

## How to
1. Clone the repository
2. run `yarn intall` or `npm install` to install node modules in terminal
3. run `npm run build` to run the build task
4. run `run run build:watch` to run dev mode
